ok i got it pretty much fully working, i need to add in another batch of tickers

realistically, I am not sure how it is handling overnight data with holes and shit, and perhaps we should add a mean() for all gaps in the data so we just linearize the the step between the holes
solves in roughly 1 minute, not bad but that will get much worse when the data history is expanded and 5+ more tickers are brought into the mix
once the engine is running, we should try to evaluate the accuracy of the analysis and try to feed it a better feature than just price change - i get thats the risk model but perhaps we can affect the model for improved sensitivity
**please suggest some tickers you would like to see in this mix
